## Project 4: Estimating π Using Monte Carlo Simulation

### Description
This project implements a statistical simulation technique to estimate the mathematical constant π through random sampling.

### Mathematical Concept
The Monte Carlo method estimates π by relating the area of a circle to a square:
- A circle is inscribed within a square
- Random points are generated within the square
- The probability of points falling inside the circle is proportional to the ratio of areas
- π can be estimated using the formula: π ≈ 4 × (Points Inside Circle / Total Points)

### Implementation
1. Generate N random points (x,y) where x,y ∈ [-1,1]
2. Check if each point lies inside the unit circle using: x² + y² ≤ 1
3. Count points inside the circle and apply the estimation formula
4. Analyze accuracy with varying sample sizes (10, 100, 1000, 10000)
5. Visualize the results with a comparison to the actual value of π

### Technologies
- Python
- NumPy/Random for point generation
- Matplotlib for visualization

## Project 5: Numerical Integration Using Trapezoidal Rule

### Description
This project implements the Trapezoidal Rule to approximate definite integrals of functions, especially when analytical solutions are difficult to obtain.

### Mathematical Concept
The Trapezoidal Rule divides the integration interval [a,b] into n subintervals and approximates the area using trapezoids:

∫(a,b) f(x)dx ≈ h/2 [f(a) + 2∑(i=1 to n-1) f(xᵢ) + f(b)]

Where h = (b-a)/n is the width of each subinterval.

### Implementation
1. Define the function f(x) to be integrated (e.g., f(x) = x²)
2. Set integration limits a and b, and the number of subintervals n
3. Implement the Trapezoidal Rule algorithm
4. Calculate approximations with varying numbers of subintervals
5. Visualize the function and the trapezoid approximations

### Technologies
- Python
- NumPy for numerical calculations
- Matplotlib for visualization of the function and approximation
